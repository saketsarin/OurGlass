# OurGlass

A real-time glassmorphism themed and animated analog clock I made in my leisure time. It's called **OurGlass** because that sounds like *HourGlass* which describes both the time and theme of this clock in it.

## Features
- It is made with plain and simple CSS and Javascript.
- It shows the accurate time and battery percentage of your device by using the *Date()* and the *navigator.getBattery()* functions. (yeah I know it's deprecated but it still works so :D)
- It has a dark/light mode toggle button.
- It doesn't use any images (except the battery one which would be converted to CSS soon).
- It looks like a mobile mockup design because that was the design inspiration I saw on some random post on Instagram (I'll give credits for the design if I get some proof of who made it).

## TODO
- Add a toggle button for converting into a cool digital clock.
- Add an animated css instead of image for the battery indication.
